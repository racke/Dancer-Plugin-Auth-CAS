NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::CAS - CAS sso authentication for Dancer

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::CAS provides CAS single-sign-on authentication

    Add the plugin to your application:

        use Dancer::Plugin::Auth::CAS;

    Configure the plugin in your config:

      plugins:
        "Auth::CAS":
            cas_url: "https://your.org/sso"
            cas_version: "2.0"
            cas_user_map: "user"
            cas_attr_map:
                email: "email"
                username: "username"
                firstName: "firstname"
                lastName: "lastname"

    Call the "auth_cas" function in a before filter:

        before sub {
            # fetches the ticket via URL 'ticket' parameter
            auth_cas; 

            # or if you want to fetch the ticket yourself:
            auth_cas( ticket => $cas_ticket_id ); 
        };

    or in a route handler:

        get '/confidential' => sub {
            auth_cas;
            # Authenticated
            ...
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Cancer::Plugin::Auth::CAS provides single-sign-on (sso) authentication
    via JASIGs Central Authentication Service (CAS). See
    <http://www.jasig.org/cas>

CONFIGURATION
    The available configuration options are listed below.

  cas_url
    The URL of your CAS server

  cas_version
    The version of your CAS server, usually '2.0' or '1.0'

  cas_user_map
    This lets you choose under what name the CAS user details will be stored
    in your session. Defaults to: 'cas_user' All user attributes delivered
    by the CAS-Server will be stored as a HashRef under the session key of
    "cas_user_map". Defaults to: 'cas_user'

  cas_attr_map
    This lets you map CAS user attributes towards your own attribute names.

    Example:

        cas_attr_map:
            email: "user_email"
            username: "username"
            firstName: "first_name"
            lastName: "last_name"

    This will map the CAS user attribute "email" to "user_email" aso..

FUNCTIONS
  auth_cas ( %args )
    This function may be called in a before filter or at the beginning of a
    route handler. It checks if the client is authorized to access the
    requested path -- if not, redirects the client towards the CAS-server
    SSO login URL.

    If the login succeeds, the CAS-Server will redirect the client towards
    the first requested path including a 'ticket' as URL parameter. This
    triggers the "auth_cas" a second time, where it validates the 'ticket'
    against the CAS-Server.

    Once the ticket validation has been done, the server includes user
    attributes in its reponse to the Dancer application. These user
    attributes are stored as a HashRef in a "session" key (see
    "cas_user_map"). These attributes can be renamed/mapped towards your own
    keys with the "cas_attr_map" option.

    Parameters:

    *   "ticket" (optional)

        If you want to extract the CAS ticket yourself, then you can forward
        it explicitly with this parameter.
